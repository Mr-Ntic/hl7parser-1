HL7 parser to-do list:

- Add accessor macros to all the members of structures that need to be
  accessed from other modules (HL7_Lexer, HL7_Buffer, HL7_Node, etc.)

- Inform the callback handlers of the element's location (e.g. MSH.3.1)
  when invoking them.

- Better error reporting, including specific error codes for the possible
  error conditions and the specific location where the error occurred.

- Add support for incremental reading and writing of HL7 messages, both for
  the message and callback parsers.
